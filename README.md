# HostelHub
Developed a attendance and time management system for hostel rectors using Python and Excel database, streamlining  student tracking and record-keeping.  "If students are late and fail to check in on time, then after scanning the QR code, a buzzer will sound, and all data, including the time and date, will be stored in an Excel file."
